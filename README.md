# flashcards
app for practicing welsh vocabulary:
- add vocabulary to a dictionary with a level of confidence given for each word
- switch between english to welsh and welsh to english
- flashcards are shown with a given weight - if you are confident in the word, it is shown less often.  
- every time you get the word right, the weight goes down (i.e you will be less likely to be shown it).  
- every time you get the word wrong, the weight goes up (i.e you will be more likely to be shown it).
- when all weights are 0, they are all recalculated based on the number of guesses it took to reach full confidence. The more guesses it took, the lower the new confidence score will be (higher weight).
- you can save your progress at any time
